# Penguin Path!

This is a 2-Dimensional game where the user plays as a Penguin character. Open up the code and run the main method that is located in the StartScreen class.

Upon running the code, you will see the start screen with some instructions on how to play the game. 
    # Igloo - The igloo signifies the end destination for the penguin. 
    # Red blocks - These blocks can teleport the penguin by walking into them. They may teleport you closer to the end of the maze or set you back!
    # Black blocks - These are the walls of the maze. Be cafreful not to run into them or you will get sent back to the start!
    # Gray Block - A gray block will be moving horizontally and the penguin can use it to move betweem walls. You must time it up perfectly or you may get caught in the wall and have to restart!
    # Blinking blocks - Blocks that are part of the walls that are blinking based off the timer. If you get caught trying to get past the blinking block while it is not invisible, you will get back to the start.
    # Baby blue blocks - The safe ice path for the penguin to cross through!

# The penguin also has a set amount of lives. If you run out of lives by running into thr walls or blinking blocks, you will be jumpscared by the forbidden penguin. 

# Once you reach the end of all the levels, you have completed the game. Congrats!
